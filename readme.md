PyShower
========

A very minimal randomized image viewer written using Pyglet. 

Useful for practicing speed drawing to randomized images from a reference folder. Or heck, just viewing an offline still porn collection (how quaint)!

- Run after placing inside a folder with images.
- Press `left` or `right` to change images manually, upon which auto-play is stopped.
- Auto-play can be turned on or of with `space`.
- Auto-play speed is controlled with `+` or `-`.
- Press `f11` to go fullscreen.
